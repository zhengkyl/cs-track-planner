# Purdue CS Track Planner
Purdue has an academically challenged track system created by a room full of fecal-matter-throwing monkeys. That is why I created (am creating) a **simple** website to navigate this excrement-covered trainwreck.

## Types of courses
    - Required
        Your run of the mill, need it to graduate, course
    - Elective
        Classes that don't matter, but do anyways
### my madeup terms
    - Equired
        Required classes that count as electives
    - Choose
        Groups of courses, where only 1 gives credit
    - Overflow
        Required classes that can count toward elective credit if Required requirements filled

## Rules of the game
A class cannot count for both **REQUIRED** and **ELECTIVE CREDIT**. In this case, "equired" are still electives.
